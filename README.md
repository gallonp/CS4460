Registration week at Georgia Tech is no doubt one of the most frustrating times of the year. With so many classes to choose from and multiple sources of information for advice about which classes to take, students easily get overwhelmed and lost in the data. To help combat this problem, we wanted to create a visualization tool that would help students at Georgia Tech make more informed choices when planning their schedules for future semesters. 

After analyzing the existing systems that operate with a similar mission, we found that the main gap in software was a tool that allowed users to compare and contrast different potential schedules based on the overall average GPA of their schedule in order to create a more manageable workload. We first wanted to let users select which courses they were interested in taking and calculate the overall average GPA among all selected courses for a given semester. This would give users an overview of the difficulty of the course load they were thinking about taking. We also wanted to provide information regarding the variance in GPA per class depending on the semester the course was offered. 

Overall with this tool, we wanted users to be able to plan a more balanced course load and make smarter decisions about which semesters they should take certain classes.
